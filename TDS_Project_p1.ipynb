    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we aim to explore the fascinating intersection of movies and data science by building a predictive model for box office revenue. Using a dataset containing various attributes of movies, such as genre, cast, budget, runtime, release date, and more, we will analyze patterns and trends to determine what factors contribute to a film's financial success.\n"

    "We chose The Movies Dataset because it is both fascinating and rich in features, making it ideal for exploring the dynamics of the movie industry. Predicting movie revenue based on details like budget, genres, cast, and crew is an engaging real-world challenge that combines creativity with analytical problem-solving.\n",

    "<font size=4px> **About the Dataset:**</font>\n",
    "* The Dataset contains MetaData of about 45,000 movies.\n",
    "* The data also contains a table with the crew and cas members (names, gender, etc).\n",
    "* There are extra 5 tables, including: links, rating (reviews from viewers), and keywords.\n",
